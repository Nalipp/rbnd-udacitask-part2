# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
    Around 6 hours.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    Getting the filtered items to work. Feel like I am getting more comfortable
    manipulating the code but still unsure about organization and need more repetition.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    a) I thought it would be nice to add to the title if the returned items were filtered
    to help make clear what the list is for.
    b)
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
    There are so many questions I still have about organizing code in object oriented
    programming.
    When to use modules and mixins and when to use require_relative.
    Feel like I need to have access to reading code by people who are at a higher level.
    Also would really love to see best practices for managing this code and be able
    to hear the thought process from an experienced professional.
